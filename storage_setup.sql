-- Storage Setup for Avatars

-- 1. Create the 'avatars' bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Set up Security Policies for the 'avatars' bucket

-- Allow public read access to avatars
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING ( bucket_id = 'avatars' );

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar
-- We enforce that the file path starts with their user ID to prevent overwriting others
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text

-- Allow users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]

-- Allow users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
